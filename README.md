> **Note**: Ensure Node.js is installed on your system. If you‚Äôre setting up a WebSocket server locally, you may need to install additional WebSocket dependencies.

## üì• Installation

1. **Clone or Download** the repository.
3. **Install Node.js and necessary packages** recommended to use npm to install. 
4. **Start the Websocket server** by running the included start.bat file, or running >node server.js
5. **Open control.html** in a browser to access the control panel.
6. **Open progress.html** in a separate browser window or tab to view the progress bar.
7. **Add progress.html location to OBS** as a browser source. Use the File Location as the "URL" (DO NOT ENABLE "LOCAL FILE" CHECKBOX).

> **Important**: The WebSocket server must be running and accessible at ws://localhost:3000 for the app to function.

üêõ Troubleshooting
------------------

*   **Reconnection**: The app attempts to reconnect every 5 seconds if the WebSocket connection is lost.
