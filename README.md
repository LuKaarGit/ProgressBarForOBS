üïπÔ∏è Progress Bar Control Panel
This project provides a real-time control panel for a circular progress bar, updating live via WebSocket. It allows you to adjust settings like title visibility, progress values, color themes, and more. The instructions below detail setup, usage, and available options.

‚ú® Features
Adjustable Title: Toggle the title visibility and customize the displayed text.
Progress Value Controls: Set minimum, maximum, and current progress values.
Color Customization: Choose colors for the progress bar and text.
Real-Time Updates: Changes update instantly on the progress display through WebSocket.
Incremental Adjustment: Buttons to increase or decrease the current progress value.
Reset Function: Quickly reset progress to zero.
üõ†Ô∏è Requirements
Node.js: Required for setting up a WebSocket server.
WebSocket Server: Configured to connect to ws://localhost:3000.
Ensure Node.js is installed on your system. If you‚Äôre setting up a WebSocket server locally, you may need to install additional WebSocket dependencies.

üì• Installation
Clone or Download the repository.
Install necessary Node.js packages (if setting up a WebSocket server locally).
üöÄ Usage
Start the WebSocket Server (using Node.js and a library like ws):
bash
Copy code
node server.js
Open control.html in a browser to access the control panel.
Open progress.html in a separate browser window or tab to view the progress bar.
Note: The WebSocket server must be running and accessible at ws://localhost:3000 for the app to function.

‚öôÔ∏è Control Panel Options
In the control.html Panel:
Title:

Toggle title visibility with the checkbox next to "Title."
Enter a custom title in the input field. This title displays above the progress bar in progress.html.
Progress Values:

Current Value: Set the current progress value manually.
Minimum Value: Set the minimum value for progress.
Maximum Value: Set the maximum value for progress.
Increment/Decrement Buttons: Adjust the current value by increments of 1 using + and - buttons.
Color Options:

Progress Color: Choose a color for the progress bar fill.
Text Color: Set the color for the title and percentage text.
Reset Progress: Resets the progress to the minimum (0).

üîÑ Live Updates
All changes in control.html are sent to progress.html via WebSocket and applied instantly.

üêõ Troubleshooting
Connection Issues: If progress.html shows "Disconnected - Refresh to reconnect," ensure the WebSocket server is running.
Reconnection: The app attempts to reconnect every 5 seconds if the WebSocket connection is lost.
